# Gym-Scheduler-Prototype

This is my own self-made prototype of application designed to manage my own workouts and monitor my progress at the gym.
I wanted to create something useful, that simultaneously allows me to develop my knowledge and skills in creating and using APIs. 

During application projecting I got an opportunity of getting familiar with technologies like Node.js, Typescript, Express, REST API terms in practic (tested with Postman) and non-relational database type (MongoDB) with related implementations e.g. ORMs. I also managed to include JWT in the project, thanks to which I learned how does basic authorization works.
